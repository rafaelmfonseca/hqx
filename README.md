C++ implementation of hq2x and hq3x scaling algorithms. This implementation was made using [DOSBOX](http://www.dosbox.com/) and [hqxSharp](https://bitbucket.org/Tamschi/hqxsharp) as reference.

## Algorithm

The hqx algorithms ("hq" stands for "high quality" and "x" stands for magnification) is a scaling algorithms created by Maxim Stepin and it's mostly used in emulators.

The algorithm description from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hqx):

> First, the color of each of the 8 pixels around the source pixel is compared to the color of the source pixel. Shapes are detected by checking for pixels of similar color according to a threshold. This gives total of 28 = 256 combinations of similar or dissimilar neighbors. To expand the single pixel into a 2×2, 3×3, or 4×4 block of pixels, the arrangement of neighbors is looked up in a predefined table which contains the necessary interpolation patterns.

## Versions

There are two "versions" of the HQx algorithm: one to produce a sharper output and another for a smoothed output. Check out the file `HQx.cc` for more information.

## Compiling

- Open Visual Studio 2022 installer, choose "Desktop development with C++" and click "Install".

```
choco install -y --no-progress cmake --install-arguments="ADD_CMAKE_TO_PATH=System"
choco install -y --no-progress mingw gcc
mkdir build
cmake -B build
```
